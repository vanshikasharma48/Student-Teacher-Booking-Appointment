                Booking appointment systems, either online or through traditional queueing systems, are
                now popular. Several businesses, such as scheduling an appointment, employ various
                Web-based appointment systems for their patients, which improve the efficiency of the
                appointment process, reducing patient wait times and increasing the total number of
                patients treated. This research proposes a web-based appointment booking system that
                allows students and lecturers to be aware of their appointment time regardless of where
                they are by using the web or mobile devices. By connecting to the Internet, students and
                instructors can easily access the system. It also permits students to send any message,
                including the appointment's purpose and timing.
